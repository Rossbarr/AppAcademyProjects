# AppAcademyProjects
All of my completed projects and works from the AppAcademy Full-Stack-Online course.

The repository is organized to match the organization of the class. While the first couple of weeks were about getting the student used to Ruby, creating interesting projects using the language, the majority of the class was based on developing websites using Ruby on Rails for the backend. Many websites and APIs can be found throughout the repo.
